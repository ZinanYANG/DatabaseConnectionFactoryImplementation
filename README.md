# DatabaseConnectionFactoryImplementation
<ul>
  <li>Designed and implemented a versatile database connection factory in Java, leveraging the factory design pattern for abstracting database connection creation.
</li>
  <li>Enabled seamless integration and connection management across multiple database types including Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and H2.
</li>
  <li>Crafted a robust interface DatabaseConnection to standardize connection operations, ensuring extensibility and scalability of the system.
</li>
  <li>Developed a DatabaseConnectionFactory class to encapsulate the logic for instantiating database-specific connection objects, thus decoupling the client code from concrete classes.
</li>
  <li>Achieved polymorphic behavior that facilitates the addition of new database types without modifying the existing client code, enhancing the maintainability of the system.
</li>
  <li>Ensured the factory could dynamically handle the creation of connections based on runtime parameters, providing flexibility in a multi-database environment.
</li>
</ul>
